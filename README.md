# rfetch
Rainbow pfetch-like program written in golang.

> It has an kind of lolcat function called random, maybe someday I will rewrite lolcat to golang, but it will kinda be useless ngl. You are free to do it, anyways.

## Usage (y tho?)
```bash
go build fetch.go
./fetch    
```
> _Yeah that's all, it's just a small project to get more familiarized with golang and it's bizarre data types_  

You are completely free to contribute to the project if you want.  

Have a great day
